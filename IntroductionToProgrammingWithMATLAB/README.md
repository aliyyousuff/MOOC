All problems from a massive online open course named as 'Introduction to Programming with MATLAB' by Vandebilt University and offered 
on coursera.

This repository includes my solutions as well as solution from course instructor.

Warning: If you are taking this course and you are here because of Google search result please do not copy codes from here to course 
grader . If you do that you are going to learn nothing. Trust me: Programming is fun enough,it may needs time but in the end it is worth of 
giving time.
